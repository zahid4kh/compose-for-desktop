    <h2>Important: Before Running Your Project</h2>
    <p>After extracting your project, you'll need to make the Gradle wrapper executable on Unix-based
        systems (Linux and macOS). This is required because ZIP files don't preserve executable
        permissions.</p>

        <div class="platform-card">
            <h3>🐧 Linux / 🍎 macOS</h3>
            <p>Open terminal in your project directory and run:</p>
            <code>chmod +x gradlew</code>
            <p class="note">This makes the Gradle wrapper script executable</p>
        </div>

        <div class="platform-card">
            <h3>🪟 Windows</h3>
            <p>No action needed! Windows uses the <code>gradlew.bat</code> file which doesn't require
                executable permissions.</p>
            <p class="note">You can run your project directly</p>
